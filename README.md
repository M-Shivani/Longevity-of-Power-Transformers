# Longevity Prediction Model for Power Transformers
This project builds a predictive model to estimate the operational lifespan of power transformers. It aims to enhance maintenance planning and prevent unexpected failures in power grids by using machine learning techniques applied to real-world transformer data.

## Objectives
- Predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of power transformers
- Analyze the effect of operational parameters on transformer degradation
- Enable data-driven decision-making for maintenance scheduling

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering from historical transformer logs
- Correlation and trend analysis of key parameters (e.g., temperature, load, insulation)
- Machine learning model to predict lifespan using regression techniques
- Evaluation with performance metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
